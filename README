Wordpress Do

Based on the Apple's Quicksivler <http://blacktree.com/?quicksilver> and Gnome's Do <http://do.davebsd.com/>, Wordpress Do is a quick search tool and action manager. With Wordpress Do you can quickly access all your posts, pages and admin actions with a few keystrokes.

With a single keystroke ('/', on both front-end and backend) you bring up WP-Do's dialog and can readly start typing your commands.
